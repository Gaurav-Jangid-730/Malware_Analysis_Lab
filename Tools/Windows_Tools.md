Tools for Malware Analysis in Windows VM
In this section, we will cover the pre-installed tools that are already available on a Windows machine or that come as part of the operating system, as well as popular third-party tools that are widely used in malware analysis. These tools will help you inspect, monitor, and analyze malware within your isolated Windows virtual machine.

Pre-Installed Windows Tools
Task Manager

Purpose: Task Manager is a built-in Windows utility that shows running applications, background processes, and resource usage (CPU, memory, disk, and network).
Why Use It: Useful for identifying suspicious processes and services that may have been initiated by malware.
Access: Right-click the taskbar and select Task Manager, or press Ctrl + Shift + Esc.
Windows Event Viewer

Purpose: Event Viewer is a tool that logs system events, including errors, warnings, and security events.
Why Use It: After running malware, check Event Viewer for logs related to system crashes, security events, or any abnormal activities triggered by the malware.
Access: Open the Start menu, type Event Viewer, and press Enter.
Windows Defender Firewall

Purpose: Windows Defender Firewall controls inbound and outbound network traffic based on rules.
Why Use It: While you may disable the antivirus part of Windows Defender during malware analysis, the firewall can be useful for observing and blocking suspicious network traffic initiated by malware.
Access: Type Windows Defender Firewall in the Start menu and press Enter.
Popular Malware Analysis Tools for Windows
Here are some popular third-party tools widely used in the malware analysis community. These tools help you perform dynamic analysis, reverse engineering, and behavior tracking of malware samples.

1. Process Hacker
Purpose: An advanced task manager and system monitoring tool that allows you to view and control running processes, services, and network activity.

Why Use It: Process Hacker provides more detailed information than Task Manager, including process memory usage, handles, and the ability to suspend, terminate, or inject code into processes. This is essential for identifying and controlling malicious processes.

2. PEiD (Portable Executable Identifier)
Purpose: PEiD is a lightweight tool that detects packers, cryptors, and compilers used in executable files.

Why Use It: Malware is often packed or encrypted to evade detection. PEiD helps you identify the packer used, which is critical when preparing to unpack or deobfuscate malware before deeper analysis.

Download: Available on trusted malware analysis repositories or via older software archives.

3. Autoruns (Sysinternals Suite)
Purpose: Autoruns displays every program that is set to run during system boot or login, including services, scheduled tasks, and registry entries.

Why Use It: Malware often configures itself to start automatically by modifying registry keys or adding startup programs. Autoruns helps you easily detect any suspicious additions.

4. Wireshark
Purpose: A network protocol analyzer used for capturing and inspecting network traffic in real time.

Why Use It: Malware typically communicates with remote command-and-control servers. Wireshark allows you to capture and analyze this network traffic to determine the malware’s behavior, such as data exfiltration or receiving commands.

5. Regshot
Purpose: Regshot is a registry comparison tool that allows you to take "snapshots" of the Windows registry before and after running malware.

Why Use It: Many malware samples make changes to the Windows registry for persistence or disabling security features. Regshot helps you pinpoint exactly what registry changes have occurred after running the malware.

6. FakeNet-NG
Purpose: FakeNet-NG is a dynamic network analysis tool that simulates various network services and intercepts malware's network communications.

Why Use It: By simulating DNS, HTTP, HTTPS, and other services, FakeNet-NG allows you to capture and observe network traffic from malware in a controlled environment without letting it access the internet.

Download: FakeNet-NG on GitHub

7. ApateDNS
Purpose: ApateDNS is a DNS manipulation tool that allows you to redirect DNS requests to local resources instead of letting the malware reach external servers.

Why Use It: Many malware samples rely on DNS queries to locate command-and-control servers or perform malicious downloads. By redirecting DNS requests, ApateDNS helps you monitor these attempts without letting the malware communicate with external servers.

Download: Available on GitHub and other malware analysis repositories.

8. Volatility Framework
Purpose: Volatility is an open-source memory forensics tool used to analyze memory dumps to detect malware, hidden processes, injected code, and other malicious activity.

Why Use It: When malware operates in memory, it often leaves traces like hidden processes or injected code that are not visible on disk. Volatility helps you extract this information from memory dumps.

9. Cuckoo Sandbox
Purpose: Cuckoo Sandbox is an automated malware analysis platform that runs files in an isolated environment and generates a detailed report on its behavior, including file system changes, API calls, and network communications.

Why Use It: Cuckoo Sandbox automates the malware analysis process and is useful for analyzing complex samples that require interaction with the operating system or network.

10. x64dbg
Purpose: x64dbg is a powerful open-source debugger for analyzing 64-bit (and 32-bit) executables.

Why Use It: For reverse engineering, x64dbg allows you to step through a malware sample’s code, observe instructions at runtime, and identify critical malware functions such as encryption routines or payload delivery.

Additional Recommendations
Disable Windows Defender: Before running any malware, ensure that Windows Defender or any other antivirus is turned off to avoid interference with your analysis.

Revert to Snapshot After Analysis: After running and analyzing malware, always revert to a clean snapshot of your Windows VM to maintain a clean state for future analysis.

Isolate the Network: Use VMware’s Host-Only or NAT networking modes to ensure that your malware samples can’t affect other machines or reach the internet.

By using a combination of pre-installed Windows tools and these popular third-party malware analysis tools, you can thoroughly inspect and dissect malicious software in a controlled environment. These tools will give you insight into the malware's behavior, persistence mechanisms, network traffic, and system modifications.
